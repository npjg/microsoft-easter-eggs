![Windows flag waving in the digital wind](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npjg/microsoft-easter-eggs/main/examples/Windows%20Flag.gif)
This repository holds Python scripts to extract (and eventually modify)
the assets for Easter eggs from Microsoft products.

Each bottom-level directory holds an `export.py` that takes the input 
Easter egg source file(s) and an export path to extract the resources
for that easter egg.
