# Microsoft Easter Eggs

This repository holds Python scripts to extract (and eventually modify)
the assets for Easter eggs from Microsoft products.

Each bottom-level directory holds an `export.py` that takes the input 
Easter egg source file(s) and an export path to extract the resources
for that easter egg.
